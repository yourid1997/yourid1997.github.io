- [Pricing assignment Swapfiets](/pdf/Pricing Group Presentation.pdf)
Worked in a team to identify pricing improvements for bike company Swapfiets.
We first collected data about Swapfiets' current subscription price model and compared this with competitor prices of new- and second hand bikes.
We then visualized the data using Tableau and concluded with practical recommendations.
I had an analytical role in the team. I mainly focused on the data we needed to collect as input for insightfull graphs and focused on the recommendations.
My most outstanding recommendation was a model where clients pay a lower monthly fee, based on the consequtive months the user didn't have any damage to the bike.
This would result in lower repair cost and lower monthly fee.
