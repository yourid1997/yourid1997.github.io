<br>
Thesis Subject: Text analytics on google Chromecast product reviews. <br>
I applied natural language processing on the text in Google Chromecast reviews to discover what product features make customers satisfied or dissatisfied. <br>
I measured satisfaction with review rating. I split the review text into words, such that each word becomes a separate variable in the dataset. <br>
I performed logistic regression (supervised learning) to predict what features differentiate between satisfied and dissatisfied customers. <br>
I also performed topic modelling, with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (unsupervised learning), to find groups of words that could give information why a customer is (dis)satisfied with the Chromecast. <br>
<br>
My insights could help managers in three ways: <br>
1. to dynamically improve insights of customer preferences, as the input data could constantly add new customer reviews. <br>
2. Information about what product features need improvement in updates. <br>
2. Use the topics to segment the customers based on how they perceive the product or service. <br>

- [Business case Unilever](/pdf/Presentation Unilever.pdf)
<br>
Worked in a small team on an Unilever business case for two months. <br>
We obtained stakeholder requirements, analyzed their data and ran machine learning models to segment customers. <br>
The case required practical recommendations, which trained me to translate technical model language to interpretable business improvements. <br>

### Msc. Marketing Management projects

- [Pricing assignment Swapfiets](/pdf/Pricing Group Presentation.pdf)
Worked in a team to identify pricing improvements for bike company Swapfiets.
We first collected data about Swapfiets' current subscription price model and compared this with competitor prices of new- and second hand bikes.
We then visualized the data using Tableau and concluded with practical recommendations.
I had an analytical role in the team. I mainly focused on thinking what data we needed to collect as input for insightfull graphs. I also focused on the recommendations.
My most outstanding recommendation was a model where clients pay a lower monthly fee, based on the consequtive months the user didn't have any damage to the bike.
This would result in lower repair cost and lower monthly fee.
