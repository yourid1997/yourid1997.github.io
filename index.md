### Extracurricular projects
<br>
#### Artificial Intelligence Marketing project in Python <br>
The goal of this project is to use AI and Machine Learning to perform customer segmentation. <br>
I started with data exploration to identify missing values, errors. I also visualised interesting patterns and how the variables correlate. <br>
Moreover, I performed data cleaning, scaled the variables and changed some variables such that the models can use them as input. <br>
I used the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into separate groups. The means of clusters enabled me to describe characteristics of each cluster. <br>
In addition, I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. PCA serves as more information to describe the clusters. <br>
<br>
I really enjoyed to dive into the data and learn more ways to clean and prepare data for analysis. <br>
Furthermore, I enjoyed to improve my programming skills in Python. <br>
Lastly, I really enjoyed to learn about data visualisation packages 'Seaborn' and 'Plotly'. <br>

- [Master thesis text analytics](/pdf/presentation thesis defense.pdf) <br>

Thesis Subject: Text analytics on google Chromecast product reviews. <br>
I applied natural language processing on the text in Google Chromecast reviews to discover what product features make customers satisfied or dissatisfied. <br>
I measured satisfaction with review rating. I split the review text into words, such that each word becomes a separate variable in the dataset. <br>
I performed logistic regression (supervised learning) to predict what features differentiate between satisfied and dissatisfied customers. <br>
I also performed topic modelling, with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (unsupervised learning), to find groups of words that could give information why a customer is (dis)satisfied with the Chromecast. <br>
<br>
My insights could help managers in three ways: <br>
1. to dynamically improve insights of customer preferences, as the input data could constantly add new customer reviews. <br>
2. Information about what product features need improvement in updates. <br>
3. Use the topics to segment the customers based on how they perceive the product or service. <br>

- [Business case Unilever](/pdf/Presentation Unilever.pdf)
Worked in a small team on an Unilever business case for two months. <br>
We obtained stakeholder requirements, analyzed their data and ran machine learning models to segment customers. <br>
The case required practical recommendations, which trained me to translate technical model language to interpretable business improvements. <br>

- [Master thesis customer retention](/pdf/thesis defense presentation.pdf) <br>

Thesis Subject: Influence of purchase decision involvement on customer retention. <br>

<img src="images/Customer decision journey.jpg?raw=true"/> <br>
The thesis was all about the customer decision journey presented in the above image.
The goal was to enlarge literature focusing on why customers tend to retain to their previously bought brand. <br>
This could help brand managers with targeting strategies for their retention campaigns. <br>
I investigated whether an individuals purchase decision involvement, which is the level of interest and concern during the product purchase, influences the likelihood to retain to the brand next purchase. <br>
I also measured whether purchase decision involvement influences the relation between a negative purchase experience and customer retention. I expected that individuals with lower involvement tend to be influenced more by a negative experience in terms of their likelihood to retain to the brand. 
The next step was to test these hypotheses with data analysis. For this, I desigend a survey, created questions and collected responses. <br>
There were two interesting conclusions: <br>
1. Individuals with more involvement in the purchase decision tend to have higher likelihood of customer retention.
2. The effect of a negative purchase experience on customer retention is more negative for low involved customers compared to high involved customers. This effect become clearer with the help of data visualization in Tableau as shown below. <br>

My insights could help managers in three ways: <br>
1. Get to know their customers better, by measuring their customer's purchase decision involvement in data collection. For example, they could use purchase decision involvement as extra information to perform customer segmentation. <br>
2. I would target relatively low involved customers for retention campaigns, when resources are limited. This is because this group's beliefs about and attitudes towards a brand are more likely to be affected by a retention campaign. <br>
3. Help with purposefull targeting. I would target relatively high involved individuals,when the focus is on a relatively small highly engaged/loyal customer base
I would target relatively low involved individuals, when the focus is on a relatively large customer base at the cost of less brand engagement. <br>

- [Pricing assignment Swapfiets](/pdf/Pricing Group Presentation.pdf) <br>
Worked in a team to identify pricing improvements for bike company Swapfiets. <br>
We first collected data about Swapfiets' current subscription price model and compared this with competitor prices of new- and second hand bikes. <br>
We then visualized the data using Tableau and concluded with practical recommendations. <br>
I had an analytical role in the team. I mainly focused on thinking what data we needed to collect as input for insightfull graphs. I also focused on the recommendations. <br>
My most outstanding recommendation was a model where clients pay a lower monthly fee, based on the consequtive months the user didn't have any damage to the bike.
This would result in lower repair cost and lower monthly fee. <br>
